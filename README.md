Fetch json from server using Volly and show them in a RecyclerView

Hello Dears.
In this simple example i've just created an application that fetch data from "https://api.androidhive.info/json/movies_2017.json"
In this application I use JOSN Request as well as Gson to show you how easy is Gson library.
Eventually I show them in a recyclerview .
